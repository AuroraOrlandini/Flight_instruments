# Flight instruments
## Pressure based flying instruments
For correct flight conduct, aircrafts are equipped with a certain number of instruments which ensure the correct functioning of all systems and the mission success. These instruments can be based on magnetic field, pressure or gyroscopic effects measures handled by computers and displayed in the cockpit. Nowadays the load of devices has been greatly reduced, thanks to the use of a limited number of displays. What still remain are the essential instruments for flight conduct such as the altimeter, the instrument under study in this report. 

The altimeter falls under the class of instruments based on pressure measures, and provides the altitude values (being the temperature and pressure at the reference altitude known) thanks to an aneroid capsule. The report dwells on three kinds of standard calibrations of the altimeter: QNE, QNH, QFE and highlights their differences and importance.

The aim of this report was to esteem different quantities in relation to the mission of an aircraft flying from Lima to La Paz airports following the given data:

| | **Location** | **Altitude [m]** | **Local pressure [hPa]** | **Local temperature [Â°C]**|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Take off airport | Lima | 35 | 1020 | 20 |
| Landing airport | La Paz | 4060 | 625 | 5 |

Specifically the requirements were to:

* esteem the theoretical conditions of temperature and pressure at sea level of both airports;
* compile a table with QFE, QNH, QNE altitudes as functions of the real altitude above La Paz (stopping at 11.000 m);
* plot altitude-time profiles during the flight mission, on the assumption of assigned airway FL 320 and maximum altitude of 38.000 ft, stationary weather conditions during landing and take off and a linear variation of cruising altitude between the two airports;
* plot TAS, EAS profiles as functions of altitude during climb (at constant CAS = 280 kts) to the assigned FL.
After a brief theoretical introduction about the involved instrument of the altimeter, I proceeded,  using MATLAB, with all the calculations
